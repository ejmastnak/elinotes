# Gaia roadmap

## Labels

### Label infrastructure

  - ~~Given margins: 3 mm on all sides~~
  - ~~Given bleed area: 3 mm on all sides~~
  - ~~Crop marks~~
  - ~~"Hello world" text~~
  - ~~Colored background using CMYK colors~~
  ~~Export as PDF, verify geometry and colors are as expected.~~
- ~~Scribus MWE: add an SVG image imported from Inkscape.~~
  ~~Export as PDF, verify geometry and color model is correct.~~
- ~~Map Tailwind colors to CMYK~~
- ~~Dimensions: define document dimensions, bleed area, margins for each label~~
- ~~Colors: define color palette for each label (foreground, background, text color...)~~
- ~~Create scripts for converting between Tailwind RGB and CMYK colors~~

- ~~Generate order confirmations from web app~~
- ~~Send customers PDF order confirmations by email upon customer placing and order~~
- Repeat for predračuns

## Financials and legal

### Financials (legal research)

Answer questions:

- ~~What are the legal requirements for the direktor of a d.o.o. (do they have to be paying prispevki? Can the direktor be an s.p.?)~~
- ~~Clearly enumerate all obligations of a micro d.o.o. like Gaia (e.g. quarterly DDV reports and payments; end-of-year financial reports; keeping books in accordance with SRS, etc.)~~
- ~~Requirements for bookkeeping (any required format for transactions or account names; certification requirements for bookkeeping software, etc.)~~
- ~~Requirements for legally accepting cash as payment (akt o blagajniškem poslovanju; acquiring digitalno potrdilo; protocol and relevant davčna blagajna software/hardware for selling products for cash in accordance with `Pravilnik o izvajanju Zakona o davčnem potrjevanju računov`; protocol for depositing cash at bank; etc.)~~
- ~~Find authoritative source for konti used by Slovene Accounting Standards (SRS)~~

### Financials (bookkeeping)

- ~~Map each current Gaia account to an appropriate account used by Slovene Accounting Standards (SRS)~~

- ~~Set up and learn to use davčna blagajna software~~
- ~~Acquire a receipt printer and learn to use; or otherwise solve workflow of giving customers a copy of receipt (solution, for now: send PDF of receipt to customers)~~

### Financials (taxes and financial reports)

- ~~Document protocol for paying DDV following DDV-O (quarterly DDV form submitted to FURS), and recipe for recording the transactions in your books.~~
- ~~Create script to programatically generate a DDV report from journal entries for a given date range~~
- ~~Clearly enumerate all required end-of-year financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.), their deadlines, and to which government agencies they must be submitted~~

### Financials (compliant bookkeeping software)

Acquire or set up bookkeeping software in compliance with SRS and ZDavP člen 38.

Either find, set up, and learn to use some sort of Slovene-oriented bookkeeping SaaS, or see if you can find a solution by combining plain-text accounting with immutable audit logs or append-only ledger tables.

### Legal: direktorstvo

- ~~Gaia direktorstvo resolved — transferred to a Mastnak without obligation to pay prispevki~~
- ~~Draft all legal documents needed for direktorstvo transfer~~
- ~~Sign and store copies of *Pogodba o poslovodenju*~~

## Facilities and infrastructure

  Perhaps transfer existing JabKis to cleaned empty cisterns and clean out previously-full cisterns, too.
- Set up a pumping workflow that can transfer JabKis between IBCs.
- Classify and label each IBC as either home use or Gaia use.
- Staging jugs: acquire enough 3-5 liter food-safe HDPE jugs to hold e.g. 25 L personal and 25 L Gaia use; label each jug according to personal use or Gaia use.
- Have bottles, caps, and stoppers for JabKis stored in crates in MalaŠtala.

### Supporting infrastructure for products

- ~~Location for "on-show" products at TV47 and LJ16, where if someone visits you at TV47 or LJ16 and hears about Gaia and asks "oh cool can I see your stuff" you just hop to the product area and pull out a few samples.~~

## Inventory

You need to know how much JabSok330, JabSok750, and JabKis you have to sell via Gaia, as well as available Bottle1000 and Bottle500 for selling JabKis.
Like frictionless, immediately, so when a wholesale customer asks "how much of X do you have/can you supply" you can rattle the number off immediately.

### Research and bookkeeping workflows

- ~~Clearly enumerate which inventory items must be kept track of in a dedicated inventory ledger to be compliant with SRS~~
- ~~Document SRS-compliant format of inventory ledgers~~
- ~~Do `the_bottles`, an analog of `the_apples` for inventory bookkeeping: enumerate transactions (e.g. purchase of empty bottles, consuming of bottles to produce juice, labelling bottles, selling juice, etc.).~~
 ~~Record Beancount recipe for associated at-cost bookkeeping of each transaction.~~
- ~~Make a demo/proof-of-concept where you record a few dummy transactions representing various stages of the production lifecycle for e.g. JabSok and JabKis and then practice querying which cost lots of which materials you have in inventory at any given time over the production period.~~
- Meatspace infrastructure to support recording changes in 320, 602, and 630 inventory accounts during each phase of production (e.g. notebook in basement coupled with secondary Beancount ledger).

### Establish inventory

- Take physical inventory of required items
- Based on results of inventory-taking, create inventory ledgers in Beancount for relevant items

## Marketing

### Pricing investigation

- ~~Record prices and other relevant parameters (country of origin, packaging, manufacturer, etc.) of all JabSok and JabKis sold at major LJ supermarkets (Hofer, Lidl, Mercator, Spar, Tuš, Mueller)~~
- ~~Transfer prices to computer-readable format, e.g. JSON/YAML or a database~~
- ~~Write simple scripts to find average price liter under given constraints (e.g. bio/not bio, Slovene/not Slovene, by store, etc.)~~
- ~~Investigate graphs/charts/etc. for presenting data~~

### Visits and spreading word

~~Visit family and friends to show the items you are selling at Gaia, ask for advice and contacts, pitch products:~~

- ~~Srečo and Nada~~
- ~~Matjaž and Cvetka~~
- ~~Oskar~~
- ~~Pretners~~

### Sales

- Contacts: try reaching out for leads/advice to:
  - ~~Žan~~
  - ~~Maj via Oskar~~
  - Klemen
- StnOlj wholesale: Nada's massage friend and contacts
- Research possible wholesale customers for JabSok in LJ: fancy "Slovenian" local-goods restaurants, stores, etc.; come up with a list of e.g. 5-10 possible customers

## Product R&D

Establish new Gaia products with good supporting infrastructure:

- Teas: drying rack for drying herbs, vessels for intermediate transfer/transport; storage for dried herbs, storage for packaging bags.
- Jams: station for washing; bowls/containers for temporary holding and transport; pitting workflow as necessary; storage for canning jars; burner and pots for cooking; burner, pots, canning tongs, rack for canning; storage for finished goods.
