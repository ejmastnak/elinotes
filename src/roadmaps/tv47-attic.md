# TV47 attic remodel

## Week 0 (17 November 2025): Plans and bill of materials

Finalize construction plans, prepare corresponding materials list, research suppliers and decide on supplier, assemble bill of materials, place order, arrange payment and delivery

## Week 1 (24 November 2025): Preparations and layout

### Order

- Arrange, and be on site to receive, help unload, and sign off on first main delivery of construction materials.
- Move all materials to attic or other sheltered location out of weather

### Clean-up

- Research and purchase an appropriate jobsite vacuum cleaner
- Purchase accesory cleaning supplies: a few good push-brooms, dust pans, contractor/heavy-duty garbage bags.
- Empty *everything* west of chimney, such that you are left with bare slab
- Clean slab of dust so that you can snap visible chalklines
- Remove T&G finish from ceiling and store safely

### Layout

Snap chalklines marking perimeter of subfloor (attic partition wall, perimeter walls, bathroom walls):

- For bathroom east wall, drop a plumb bob from rafter as reference—center wall below rafter.
- For bathroom south wall, drop a plumb bob from beam as reference—wall flush with beam so drywall can come up over beam.
- For bathroom north wall place toilet bottom plate relative to downstairs bathroom vent hole. For bath bottom plate measure perpendicularly out from south wall, referring to plans.
- For bathroom west wall measure out from west exterior wall such that bathroom west wall aligns with remaining west perimeter wall.
- For main east partition wall, place wall on *interior side* of chimney rafter, to allow sufficient space between chimney and wall on exterior side (fire safety, etc.)
- Mark position of toilet, sink, bathtub, and floor drain on bathroom floor

## Plumbing rough-in (pending plumber availability)

- Install radiator supply and return lines with stub-out that will reach up into bathroom south wall
- Run DWV and supply lines from basement to attic.
- Lay DWV pipe for upper bathroom toilet, bath, sink, and floor drain, accounting for 100 mm AAC + 10 mm tile floor.
- Lay supply lines for upper bathroom toilet, bath, and sink, with stub-outs accounting for 100 mm AAC + 10 mm tile floor.

## Week 2 (1 December 2025): DWV ventilation

Set up ducting/vent lines for upper bathroom vent fan, upper bathroom DWV vent stack, and lower bathroom ventilation:

- Install DWV vent lines for upper bathroom in west wall and leave stub-out in north wall utility cavity.
- Install vent lines for lower bathroom in west wall and leave stub-out in north wall utility cavity.
- Install duct for ventilation fan in west wall and leave sufficient stub-out to reach into bathroom.

Set up ducting for ventilation fan through roof gable vent.

## Week 2 (1 December 2025): Subfloor

- Build subfloor grid: bottom layer is 5 cm and runs north/south to accomodate radiator lines.
- Install electrical conduit and cable under subfloor grid, allowing enough stub-out to reach eventual junction boxes in wall
  (Run trunk lines along N/S perimeter walls where floor grid won't reach, then branch into interior as needed.)
- Install OSB floor panels

## Week 3 (8 December 2025): Framing

### West wall

- Install insulation and vapor barrier along west wall, tacking down vapor barrier to OSB subfloor on bottom and ceiling planking on top. On top, leave enough vapor barrier to come over and around top plate of wall and down to ledger.
- Frame west wall (bathroom and living space), fastening bottom plate to OSB subfloor and top plate to roof planking.
- Install a ledger on west wall parallel to rafters to attach ceiling finish to (ledger is installed over overlapped vapor barrier that comes up and over top plate).
- Install electrical conduit, cable, and boxes in west wall, accounting for 12.5 mm drywall finish in bathroom and TODO vertical T&G in living space.
  Include electrical supply for gable ventilation fan
- Verify ducting is properly installed for gable vent

### North and south walls

- Install insulation and vapor barrier along north and south walls, tacking down vapor barrier to OSB subfloor on bottom and rafters on top, leaving enough vapor barrier to wrap over and be stapled onto front face of top plate.
- Frame N/S perimeter walls, attaching bottom plate to OSB subfloor and top plate to bottom of rafters.

### East wall

- Frame east partition wall, building on interior side of chimney rafter.
- Sheath exterior of east partition wall with OSB
- Install electrical conduit, boxes, and cable on east partition wall, accounting for TODO mm vertical T&G finish.
- Insulate east partition wall
- Install vapor barrier on interior of east partition wall, stapling to OSB subfloor on bottom and ceiling planking on top.

## Week 4 (15 December 2025): Ceiling

- Install electrical conduit, boxes, cable, and necessary blocking for ceiling lighting in ceiling, accounting for TODO T&G finish ceiling.
  (Take into account blocking for terminating T&G on around ceiling lights)
- Install roof insulation + vapor barrier in ceiling.
  Along N/S walls, staple vapor barrier to top plate of N/S walls, overlapping wall vapor barrier.
  Along E/W walls, staple vapor barrier over ledger and onto E/W walls, overlapping wall vapor barrier.
- Reinstall T&G finish ceiling, except for in bathroom; cut holes and leave stub-out cable for recessed ceiling lighting.

  - Prime bathroom floor in preparation for pouring self-leveling compound
  - Pour self-leveling compound on bathroom floor
  - Redraw positions of bath, toilet, sink, and floor drain on dried self-leveling compound

### Cement board and drywall

- Install cement board on walls and ceilings, going all the way to floor slab with cement board.
- Finish cement board around bath with waterproof coating, e.g. Murexin KEMA HIDROSTOP

### Floor

- Install AAC floor to raise finish floor level to allow required slope for drain/waste lines, leaving channels for drain and supply lines.
  Use reinforced concrete instead of AAC under bath and toilet.
- Set drain/waste lines at sufficient slope with mortar.
