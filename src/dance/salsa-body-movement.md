## Footwork variations

## Gíros lineales

- **Giro derecho (into ground):**

  - L forward; can point rightward 45 to 90ish degrees to prepare for turn
  - R turn (into floor) 180-ish degrees to point behind you; hips face behind you.
  - L wraps around R to complete turn and point forward; hips face forward;
    L can land behind R so as to shift body weight backward, like on 3 of regular linear básico.

  Complete 360 degree turn on 3 count (open to interpretation).
  Keep split stance throughout for better balance.

- **Giro izquierdo: (out of ground)**

  - L forward as in standard básico
  - R in place as in standard básico; can point leftward 45 to 90ish degrees to prepare for turn
  - L turn (out of floor) 180-ish degrees to point behind you; hip face behind you;
  - R wraps around L to complete turn and point forward; hips face forward;
    R can land behind L so as to shift body weight backward, like on 5 of regular linear básico.

  Complete 360 degree turn on 5 count (open to interpretation).

## Giros laterales

Performed from lateral básico.

- **Giro derecho (into ground):**

  - L exaggerated lateral step L to open up body; can point 45ish degrees right to prepare for turn
  - R pivots to face 3 o'clock; land in split lunge facing 3 o'clock
  - L hooks around L to complete remaining 270 degrees of turn;
    weight should land on L foot, preparing you to step R into next half of lateral básico

- **Giro izquierdo (out of ground):**

  - Begin with LRL+rest of standard lateral básico
  - R exaggerated lateral step R to open up body; can point 45ish degrees left to prepare for turn
  - R pivots to face 9 o'clock; land in split lunge facing 9 o'clock
  - R hooks around L to complete remaining 270 degrees of turn;
    weight should land on R foot, preparing you to step L into next half of lateral básico

- **Variation: giros laterales from linear básico:** perform giros laterales from standard linear básico footwork.
