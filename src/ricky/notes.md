# June 2025 Notes

## Splits protocol

- Straight-leg inner thigh stretch 3x15s chest to ground.
  Standing psoas stretch after (front and side)
- Splits progression (e.g. first with FR, then foam pad, then ground).
  Foam roll hip flexor with e.g. tennis ball before and after.

## 2025-06-20

Following blackboard Wednesday from NHL era, with some modifications for weakness/inactivity:

- SL DB clean 3x4 es
- Supine barbell hip push-ups with shoulders on Bosu, 4-4-8-6-8 with tempo.
  *Idea is that hip flexors are tight, so don't want to go right into concentric squats. Instead open up hips with hip thrusts first.*
- Back squats but only to 25 degree, *first hip flexion, only then knee flexion*.
  Idea is quads are overcompensating and hamstrings are weak from inactivity, so train correct hip motion first.
  Box jumps between sets, 2 reps per set.
- SL/SA DB row on Bosu 2x4
- SL overhead barbell squat 3x2 es
  SL hamstring curls between sets 4 reps es.
- SL barbell RDL on Bosu 2x3 es (with non-loaded leg straight, next to loaded leg, not into hip extension)
- SL ADD bridge on EB with golf chop. With e.g. 2lb DB. Difficult! 2x5 es
- Double PB
- Walking on FR

Note: on loss of control during SL overhead squat, corrected with extra SL hamstring curls on lost-balance leg, followed by DL hamstring curls, followed by SL hamstring curls with hip thrust on EB (leg extended, bring into hamstring curl, go into hip thrust, reverse)
