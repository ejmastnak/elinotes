# EliPortfolio

## Sketches: TMG

- In a markdown file sketch outline of algorithm for computing TMG parameters (input, output, algorithm)
- In a markdown file sketch outline of MC binary decoder (input, output, algorithm)
- Investigate feasibility API documentation page for `tmg-toolkit` Python library
- Sketch high-level steps at "systems level" of MC sensor, just in a markdown file is fine
- Decide pictures/screenshots to include and features to present for SPM signal analysis
- Sketch of features of ChatTMG (include publications, demonstration videos, etc.)

## Sketches: Gaia

- Labels write-up: list every technical term in LabelProfi order that you will explain
- UPNQR: make clear list of all specs you need to meet standard; find canonical reference to standard
- Label tips: make list
- Scribus color management write-up: sketch steps at a "system level" from inputs to outputs in a markdown file.
- Label tips in meatspace: list tips and pictures to take in a markdown file
- Gaia PDF documents write-up: sketch steps at a "system level" from inputs to outputs in a markdown file.
- Gaia crates: list content to include and pictures to take
- Look through `the-apples.md` and update as needed to make presentable
- Look through KateriKonto and polish

## Ideas

### TMG

- Write-up of numerical methods used in basic algorithm for TMG signal analysis (e.g. part 1 and part 2 for signal and for derivative)
- Technical write-up: reverse-engineered MC binary decoder
- Technical write-up: listening to muscles with the MC sensor
- Presentation: Interface for signal analysis (TMGToolkit web app)
- Presentation: ChatTMG
- Presentation of `tmg-toolkit` Python library; e.g. make an API page with documentation?
- Abstract of articles written?

In summarizing your work with TMG note: a lot of my work involved potentiation. There was no meaningful practical application so far, it was research into a cool phenomenon.

### Gaia

- Labels technical write-up: basically explain every technical term in the LabelProfi naročilo how you would like to have been explained it. You can literally begin the article with a picture of the naročilo.
- UPN QR generator technical write-up (UPNQR standard, using the Python QR library, details of implementation to meet standard)
- Scribus color management technical write-up
- Labels tips: point out details like PP for oil, color contrast for QR codes; dimensions of barcodes for EAN codes.
- Label machine "making life easier" tutorial with tips on more easily using label machine: labelling jigs, labelling machine modifications with wing nuts to make swapping rolls better; paper clips 
- Gaia on-brand PDF documents technical write-up: workflow for feeding serialized data to a Jinja template that compiles to LaTeX (for invoices, order confirmations, etc.)

- Meatspace presentation: building crates to hold JabSok750, show CAD plans, show UIDs carved into crates, show crate stacks, show labeling Jysk box hanging on the wall and workflow for labeling crates with tacks.

- Taking pictures on DSLR of fruits and products; perhaps a few pictures of the "photo studio" itself

- Web site internationalization technical write-up: recipe for i18n in a Vue frontend site; recipe for i18n in a Laravel site for web shop
- Web presentation: screenshots of developing web shop and web site, "we do our own website blah blah", etc.
- Book-keeping blog: show `the-apples.md` as ("example accounting workflow for a small production business"); link to KateriKonto
