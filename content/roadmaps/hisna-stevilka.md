# Hisna Številka

## Infrastructure

- Set up dedicated HisnaŠtevilka box containing:

  - notebook/package of thin paper for tracing
  - pencils for tracing from screen onto paper
  - masking tape for taping template paper onto monitor and wood

- Computer infrastructure: project directory and file in which you choose font and adjust font size for producing templates
- Validate if tracing directly from paper onto wood without intermediate step of cutting out paper to make template produces workable lines on wood
- Set up box with dedicated supply of wood for sign and backing
- Set up a HisnaŠtevilka project directoy on computer
- Build and inaugurate dedicated table, e.g. OSB panels on sawhorses is fine, on which to do carvings.
