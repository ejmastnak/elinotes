## Nice apartment to drop into

Clean up and order my apartment into a state such that I'd be pleased and proud to have people drop in whenever, unannounced, i.e. without my needing to clean things up.

- LJ16 house number
- LJ16 toilet paper holder
- LJ16 bathroom trash bin
- LJ16 kitchen trash bin
- Cleaning supplies area

## Next

- Bathroom switches redoza
- Bike racks in basement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aiqv3RiO0Lo

## Visions

- A tablet running EliMusic is a next step above PiAmbient. Like, a finger-controlled interface to EliMusic where you can see all the songs laid out in front of you, without having to memorize all the track IDs, and control them with e.g. swipes and pushes and so on.

- Rows and rows of clean glass spice jars in the fridge doorshelf with cool earthy shades of oranges and reds and browns and yellows holding single ingredients, holding Eli spice mixes, holding blends, etc.

- Warm cozy office in hallway room, interior wrapped entirely in warm nicely-finished wood with a nice grain, warm and inviting, plenty of outlets, beams showing wood, etc.

- In living room, a light fixture in every corner of living room around the one in the center
