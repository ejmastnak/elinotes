# TV47

## Attic gym

- Create space in attic for gym floor:
  - Clean out used building materials, fiberglass insulation, polystyrene boards, bricks, packaging, etc.
  - Disassemble, decommission, and dispose of insulation box of fiberglass batts around old hot water tank
  - Sort Dominik and Župančičeva stuff;
  - Move Župančičeva boxes from pile in center of attic to a stack around the perimeter in unused area under sloping roof
  - Process Dominik stuff into keep and dump; dispose of dump stuff, find space for keep stuff
- Install 5m x 5m floating sleeper floor (dimensions matched to standard modular dimensions of OSB panels) to elevate gym floor above concrete and create springiness in floor, shimming as needed to create a level surface
- Purchase OSB panels to use as subfloor
- Install OSB panels on sleepers
- Find and purchase rubber flooring; transport to TV47
- Install rubber flooring onto OSB subfloor
- Add vertical boards around floor perimeter, attached to sleeper floor, to keep rubber mats in place
- Move exercise equipment into gym

## Ideas

- Learn to sharpen: chainsaw chains, kitchen knives, scythes, sickles, brush cutter blades, chisels, axes, krčun.
- Krušna peč usable
- Pekarna slab
- Wood-burning stove: get to a point where you can use existing wood-burning stove to heat the house if heat pump goes down.
- Make a gym equipped for Ricky MTWT workouts
- In TV47 attic make some exercise toys for climbing around along the beams, e.g. to hand-over-hand like when Randall and I were framing Evelyn powder room.
- Make a platform-framed drying rack to replace rickety attic drying rack and learn platform framing.
- Husqvarna 560 up and running
- Generator: get to a point where if power goes out you know you can frictionlessly restore power to e.g. a few computer outlets, lights, and freezers via generator.
- Tractor up and running
- Learn welding
- Make a wood-framed greenhouse on a pier foundation as an exercise.
