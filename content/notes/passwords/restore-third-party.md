## Spec

Given a trusted third party with access to a blank Linux computer and a USB drive holding the private key encrypting my `pass` password store with whom I can talk and share a screen: 

- Give third party access to my password store
- Give third party access my SSH keys and access to all SSH hosts
- Give third party access to my Slovene digitalno potrdilo and install it on a web browser on the new computer
