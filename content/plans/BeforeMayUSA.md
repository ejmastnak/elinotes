What to do for Gaia in Slovenia before May 2025 USA trip

- Gaia direktorstvo resolved — transferred to a Mastnak without obligation to pay prispevki
- 2025 Q1 DDV-O
- Website additions:
  - Travniski sadovnjak
  - Sorte jablan
  - "kid (family) trying to make a business happen" story
  - "sell botique eko products at reasonable prices" story
- JabSok and JabKis pricing investigation in LJ supermarkets. (Hofer, Lidl, Mercator, Spar, Tuš, Mueller)
- Kis pH and acidity
- Visit Pretners to discuss farm tourism and pitch JabSok
- Have a recordkeeping system in place for inventory:
  - Do `the_bottles`, an analog of `the_apples` for inventory bookkeeping: enumerate transactions (e.g. purchase of empty bottles, consuming of bottles to produce juice, labelling bottles, selling juice, etc.).
   Record Beancount recipe for associated at-cost bookkeeping of each transaction.
  - Make a demo/proof-of-concept where you record a few dummy transactions representing various stages of the production lifecycle for e.g. JabSok and JabKis and then practice querying which cost lots of which materials you have in inventory at any given time over the production period.
  - Workflow (notebook in basement coupled with secondary Beancount ledger?) for recording changes in 320, 602, and 630 inventory accounts during each phase of production.
- Have physical space and workflows for inventory:
  - Build/acquire crates to hold remaining JabSok
  - Label crates with UIDs
  - Clean, dedicated storage space for existing inventory (bottles, caps, labels, unfinished products)
  - Workflow for delabeling returned bottles
  - Workflow for cleaning returned bottles and storing for future use
