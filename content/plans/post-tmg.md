## Personal income

What are the possible legal statuses of a Slovene person (unemployed, employed, student, retired, athlete, disabled, etc.)?

Accepted pathways for earning income:

- Nakazilo na osebni IBAN
- SP (popolandski; polni, normirani stroški; polni, dejanski stroški)
- Zaposlitev na firmi
- Zaposlitev na firmi, katere si lastnik
- Možnosti za dohodek prek firme, kateri si lastnik, brez zaposlitve

What are taxes and fees associated with each?

Gaia and directorship:

- Does a d.o.o. need a director?
- What are allowed legal statuses for the director of a d.o.o. and the tax/fee/legal implications of each? Does the director need to be employed? If so, does it matter if they are employed at the firma they are directing? Can the director be retired? Etc.
